A simple project that allows you to use PostCSS online.
I use it for [vpub-plus](https://github.com/hugmouse/vpub-plus)
by manually copy-n-pasting CSS.

As an added bonus I've also added Vite PWA plugin so you can use it offline after the initial load.

## Installation

Clone the project and run `vite build`, then `vite preview`.
